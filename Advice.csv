* They are over-the-counter (OTC) drugs that help treat both fever and pain. You can buy them at the drugstore.

* ACETAMINOPHEN REGULAR STRENGTH TYLENOL: Take 650 mg (two 325 mg pills) by mouth every 4-6 hours as needed. Each Regular Strength Tylenol pill has 325 mg of acetaminophen. The most you should take each day is 3,250 mg (10 pills a day).
* ACETAMINOPHEN - EXTRA STRENGTH TYLENOL: Take 1,000 mg (two 500 mg pills) every 8 hours as needed. Each Extra Strength Tylenol pill has 500 mg of acetaminophen. The most you should take each day is 3,000 mg (6 pills a day).
